Odoo Backend bootstrap-toggle widget for boolean fields

This is a bare bones first release of bootstrap's toggle widget.

This works in odoo version 8 (and although I have not tested, probably 9).

In your xml view file simply define any boolean field as shown below.

<field name="myboolean" widget="bs_toggle"/>

As things are right now I have not provided any additional options such as defining the text for the toggle with parameters from your field or even the ability to change the colors or sizes/shapes. Please be easy on comments as I am a new programmer and this is my first attempt at something like this.

Hope you like it!
